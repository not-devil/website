            <p>Painting something that defies the law of the land is good. Painting something that defies the law of the land and the law of gravity at the same time is ideal. The only thing I know is that I paint because I need to, and I paint whatever passes through my head without any other consideration.
            </p>
            <p>All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. If you could say it in words, there would be no reason to paint.
</p>
            <p>Ami mathur is an artist who lives in indore but provide her paintings to everyone around the country with the view to ensure that everyone can say what they can't in general but by the way of paintings. She believes Painting is just another way of keeping a diary. She is working mainly in the field of art..</p>
