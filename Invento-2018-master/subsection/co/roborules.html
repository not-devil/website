<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time
came into existence with the speed of revolution and rotation of
earth. Rotation defined velocity and velocity defined time. Thus, it
is movement which acts as a rebel against the otherwise silent time.
It is only when you race and chase, that time stops silently slipping
by and is visibly rushing. Would you like to peal off the
invisibility cloak of time?If yes! Come and join our race, where
robots experience the race against time, where each second faces
friction against the accelerating roboracers, where the robo
inventors overtake each others inventions,passion and even pride.
It’s not just a race, it’s a chase. Chasing victory which will
only come to those who possess swiftness, robustness and zeal. The
finish line is drawn; it’s not about how far it is, it’s about
how far you can go. Bring on your robots!Let’s see if you have it
in you to be the roboracer! Roborace awaits a true speedster.

Assemble your nuts and bolts and fix your tires, put the wires and motors in
their place. Think your robot can overcome any obstacle-big or small
in the least of time. If so get it on the track and let the game
begin. And bear in mind maximizing RPM doesn't always do the trick
though rising pulse rate might.<BR>They're on their own between the
start and finish lines - there are no pit stops - and the exact
course will remain a secret until the morning of the competition.<BR>You
have to maneuver your robot through a series of obstacles that could
be wired or wireless.</P>

considered dangerous can be disqualified by the judges at their
discretion.
